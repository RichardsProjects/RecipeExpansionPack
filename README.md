==============

This is the official repository for the Recipe Expansion Pack Minecraft Mod. This mod is written using the forge mod API and currently works with version 1.6.2/1.6.4/1.7.2 of Minecraft. All code is publicly available for reference and educational purposes. However, the neither the code nor fully compiled mod should ever be redistributed and doing so is a violation of the license.

The default branch contains the code for the Minecraft 1.8 rewrite of the mod. Currently the rewrite is not complete and a compiled version has not been released yet. If you would like to the see the code for the 1.7 version of the mod check out the 1.7 Branch
